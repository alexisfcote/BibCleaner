abstract = {Force feedback control is investigated for improving the quality of the haptic feedback in virtual reality applications. Advanced control design can increase the transparency of the haptic device at the haptic interface thereby increasing the realism of the simulation. Force feedback also enables the implementation of admittance control approaches heretofore considered the domain of large robotic platforms. The quality of the haptic interface is "rst quanti"ed, and the standard open-loop impedance approach to haptic control is reviewed. Dual-input control schemes with sensory force feedback are then introduced, and the resulting quality of the haptic interface is derived. A four-bar linkage example is used to illustrate the im- provement in "delity realized with the various approaches. The tradeoffs encountered in moving to force feedback controllers for haptic applications are also discussed.},

In this paper, we present a large-scale haptic device iFeel6BH1500, which is based on a cable-driven parallel mechanism and can achieve 6 dimensional force feedback by controlling the tension of eight cables. The components and working principle of the device is presented, followed by the analysis of the statics and kinematic models. Moreover, a method of friction compensation is proposed to decrease the tension error for achieving good back drivability. The measurement results show that the tension error of the cables is greatly reduced by using the friction compensation. Finally, two demos for the application of iFeel6BH1500 are presented: virtual assembly of aircraft engine and virtual shooting for entertainment. The demos show the proposed device can provide large workspace, high stiffness and good back drivability.},

abstract = {Emerging changes in health-care delivery are having a significant impact on the structure of health-care professionals' education. Today it is recognized that medical knowledge doubles every 6-8 years, with new medical procedures emerging everyday. While the half-life of medical information is so short, the average physician practices 30 years and the average nurse 40 years. Continuing education thus represents an important challenge to face. Recent advances in educational technology are offering an increasing number of innovative learning tools. Among these, Virtual Reality represents a promising area with high potential of enhancing the training of health-care professionals. Virtual Reality Training can provide a rich, interactive, engaging educational context, thus supporting experiential learning-by-doing; it can, in fact, contribute to raise interest and motivation in trainees and to effectively support skills acquisition and transfer, since the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. Current virtual training applications for health-care differ a lot as to both their technological/multimedia sophistication and to the types of skills trained, varying for example from telesurgical applications to interactive simulations of human body and brain, to virtual worlds for emergency training. Other interesting applications include the development of immersive 3D environments for training psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of mental disorders. This paper has the main aim of discussing the rationale and main benefits for the use of virtual reality in health-care education and training. Significant research and projects carried out in this field will also be presented, followed by discussion on key issues concerning current limitations and future development directions.},

This new telescope would be composed of a reflector made of individually actuated panels and a multitethered feed platform held aloft by an aerostat. This paper focuses on the position and orientation control of the feed platform. Models of both the cables and the feed platform are first derived. Then, a control strategy adapted to the particular system's dynamics is designed. This control strategy is based on a cascade-control architecture, in which the inner control loop adjusts the tension in each cable. This inner loop controller is synthesized using the H infin optimal-control technique. In addition, gain scheduling is used to adapt the H infin optimal controller to the cable lengths. The outer control loop adjusts the pose of the feed platform, using inverse-dynamics control and PID control. The model derived is coupled to the multiloop controller, and simulations are run to evaluate the performance level of the control strategy.},

abstract = {Haptic displays are special devices, able to provide the sense of force or moment feedback to the human operator by rendering a variable mechanical impedance. They are widely used in Virtual Reality, teleoperation and virtual-drive systems. In this paper, the problem of measuring the force-exertion capability of a spatial cable-driven haptic display is addressed. A new set of manipulability indexes that applies to all completely restrained cable-based spatial systems is developed, by generalizing a set of indexes previously introduced for planar devices. These indexes can be used to analyze the working space of cable-based devices and/or to optimize their parameters (e.g., the locations of cable attachment points). In the paper, the set of manipulability indexes is applied to the analysis of a desktop cable-driven haptic display, called the PiRoGa5. PiRoGa5 is a 5 degree-of freedom haptic pen, driven by 6 cables that are arranged to form two opposite pyramids, whose bases lay in two parallel planes and whose vertexes coincide with the ends of the pen-like end-effector. Wires are wound onto pulleys, pass through fixed eye-bolts, and are alternatively fixed to the upper and lower ends of the end-effector. The kinematics of the system is derived first, and position accuracy is inspected. Secondly, the new manipulability indexes are employed to determine and optimize the working space of the haptic device. Finally, a method is presented to analytically compute the wire tensions for a given wrench. Copyright  2008 by ASME.},

abstract = {This paper presents a human-scale force feedback system with string, at the end of the article there is one experiment to test system efficient. The user interacts with the virtual environment using the string to feel haptic feedback, which is called SPIDER (Space Interface Device for Artificial Reality). As the system runs, the location of the user's viewpoint will move at any time, virtual environment should catch up with the change of the viewpoint. In order to solve this problem, a calibration method is proposed. The purpose of the experiment is to examine the system stability and the unitarity of the user and the virtual environment. The result of the test indicate that as the user move his viewpoint, the virtual environment can change its scene instantly. To research several operators, the subjective evaluate reveals system establishment is correct.},
